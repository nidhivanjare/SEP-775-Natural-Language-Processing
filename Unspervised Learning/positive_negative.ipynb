I've recently become obsessed with sushi. I used to hate it, now I crave it on a daily basis. I want to eat everything with chopsticks... pizza... hotdogs... soup. whatever. \\\\n\\\\nI was really in the mood for something spicy and I'm totally over the chain \\\\\\\"\\\"Japanese/sushi\\\\\\\"\\\" establishments, i really wanted something authentic. Yelp to the rescue! \\\\n\\\\nIt was a Friday night at about 8:30 and they were packed, I take that as a good sign. If the food is that good, I don't mind waiting. I was able to use my time to read the menu and decide on my meal. \\\\n\\\\nMy seat at the sushi bar was great. The chefs are so animated and alive. They all talk to each other in a funky mix of Japanese and English while they make your meal. \\\\n\\\\nI started with the potstickers and they were delicious. Flavorful and hot and the perfect moistness, tenderness and crispy bottom. Perfect! Loved the scallion soy dipping sauce.\\\\n\\\\nThen i had the Crazy Roll. This is shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, avocado and cucumber. Huge and fresh and great. Could definitely have been way spicier for me, but I guess that's what wasabi is for. \\\\n\\\\nI would definitely come back and try everything else! \\\\n\\\\nOne glass of wine, one appetizer and one roll = about $25 with tip. Not bad!\",\n          \"Luckily, I didn't have to travel far to make my connecting flight. And for this, I thank you, Phoenix.\\\\n\\\\nMy brief layover was pleasant as the employees were kind and the flight was on time.  Hopefully, next time I can grace Phoenix with my presence for a little while longer.\",\n          \"You know how hard it is to find good sushi in Mesa...right? I like Temari,  but sometimes want a change without having to drive to Scottsdale, or, heaven forbid, suffer the indignity of eating a \\\\\\\"\\\"krab\\\\\\\"\\\" roll at one of the many \\\\\\\"\\\"bigbox\\\\\\\"\\\" china buffets in the area.  :-)  \\\\n\\\\nI just found out Sekai Sushi existed the other day...tucked away next to JoAnn Fabrics adjacent to Target.  So, I stopped in for a couple of maki rolls for lunch a few days ago.  The price was right and the taste was there too, so I went back last night to see how their sashimi and more adventurous rolls are. \\\\n\\\\nFirst off, if you Google Sekai Sushi you can find some reviews that bash this place on a couple of different fronts. Most point to poor (and unfriendly) service and decor.  I did not find that to be the case at all. We were greeted with a friendly hello and big smiles from the host and the sushi chef (dude? guy?).  The decor is also just fine. No it's not Stingray or Ra, but it is tastefully decorated and clean. It also isn't cramped like Sekana or Temari, which is nice.\\\\n\\\\nStarted off with salmon sashimi. It was excellent.  Very fresh, clean, buttery taste, and it melted in my mouth. Some of the best quality I have found in the Phoenix area.  Next stop was a Las Vegas roll, along with shrimp tempura roll.  The flavors were there, but the construction was a little lacking as they weren't as tight as they should have been.  Next time I will order more traditional rolls as I saw some go out that looked very well constructed.  I finally tried some nagiri because I felt I must....ha.   I had the hamachi (yellowtail) and I have to say, that it was the best I have ever had.  Supremely fresh, with a velvety (sp?) texture that made my eyes roll back in my head. Good stuff.   I then ended the meal with some green tea ice cream that was better than average.\\\\n\\\\nSoooo....my final thoughts.  I will be going back to Sekai Sushi.  The quality of the food along with the price make this a very attractive sushi option in Mesa.  Regarding the price....the dinner I described above along with two large Asahi's....under $40.  You can't beat that with a stick.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Matched_Sentence_from_Y\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 486,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"It's ok, quality .

But, I was looking for a good burger, too bad I didn't find it here.\",\n          \"I like the location and the bar area and the little patio, it's relaxing.  Service was very good.\\\\n\\\\nNow for the food yikes:\\\\n\\\\nChips and salsa, chips are good and light and thin.  Salsa is watery and has no flavor, the hotter salsa was a bit thicker and tasted better.\\\\n\\\\nOrdered like someone else mentioned, the carna asada chimi.  It was huge but I also got the thick chunks of meat inside, I've never seen carne asada look like that.  The worst part is the chimi was very salty.  The rice had no flavor either, so overall it was horrible, and it was expensive.\\\\n\\\\nI'm hard pressed to order any food again, possibly just drinks and hang out.\",\n          \"I hate this Safeway. I don't even think it's that ghetto, and I've never had a problem with things being out of stock. Even the prices are pretty good.\\\\nThis is the closest grocery store to my house and I try to never shop there if I can help it. The reason? There are NEVER enough cashiers. I have never ever ever ever ever ever gone in and seen more than 2 cashiers working. Why do they even have 10 checkout lines if they're only going to use ONE most of the time? This is one of the only groceries downtown so I don't understand why they would close early(...10pm I think), and have one lonely cashier working during BUSY times. I once came here in the evening around 9 and stood in line for 40 minutes to pay for the one or two things I had bought. I couldn't believe it. That was over 2 years ago, and nothing has changed here, and you KNOW they get complaints about it, but they're obviously not changing anything.\\\\nYou would be better off going to the Bashas or Safeway on 7th Ave & Osborn, or Fresh and Easy on 7th Ave and Indian School. Any time you would have saved driving to the closer grocery store would be more than lost standing in their outrageous checkout lines.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              " 'overall experience was rather good . this is an impressive review for me to give a restaurant as i consider myself an avid foodie . it is rare for me to give an italian restaurant a rave review , since i grew up eating italian american homemade meals . the ambiance was nice , the buzz was slightly nosier than i would have liked but it was also not so much so to be considered bothersome . their staff were attentive , friendly , and knowledgeable . i will say , it was a little strange to not receive a menu until after we were served water and bread sticks . i can actually say i ve never been seated at a restaurant where it took minutes to receive one . however , after munching on the delightful breadbasket the star of which is definitely the focaccia bread left me excited for what was yet to come . i enjoyed the affordable wine selection . we order an italian table wine style pinot noir . it was delightful and we would order it again . for an appetizer we shared the capesante : grilled sea scallops , shaved fennel , red onion , orange and basil . my husband and i rarely go out to eat without ordering some sort of scallop dish . i can proudly say , their scallops had a lovely sear and were cooked perfectly inside . for my entree , i ordered the lidia s pasta trio which is their signature dish . unlimited daily pasta selection served table side . i must confess , i found the serving via table side a little odd . if they served only my portion from the pan it would not have been as off . but thinking that others may have or will be served from that same dish that is inches away from the diner was a bit off . i had the linguine w walnut pesto which was average nothing too spectacular but good all around . the chicken , pork ravioli was interesting . tastier that i expected . in fact , had i not tried my husband s entree i would have been more impressed with my ravioli . lastly , it was served w eggplant penne in a red sauce . i was probably least underwhelmed by this last dish . but nevertheless , all three pastas far supersede the majority of pittsburgh italian restaurants . i order this with the caesar salad and choice of dessert . the salad was okay . admittedly , i m a hard sell with caesar as i prefer to make it myself . unless of course i am eating it from emeril s las vegas which was the best caesar i ve ever eaten . bygones . for dessert , i ordered the torta d ananas ricotta and butter cake , caramelized pineapple , amarena cherries , and coconut ice cream . if i had to guess , the cherries were present in syrup form perhaps on the top of the cake . as i did not see any cherries or taste for that matter their presence within the dish . perhaps the syrup was used sparingly . nevertheless , the dish was yummy . the coconut ice cream with the caramelized pineapple was the star . however , i do not think it was spectacular enough to order again . my husband had the ravioli di cinghale : ravioli filled with braised wild boar in a rosemary infused sauce . this dish was amazing . i could not believe how delicious every single aspect of this dish was . the ravioli looked so fresh , it appear made to order . significantly , far exceeded the quality present in the trio i ordered . the rosemary infused sauce was one of the most incredible sauces i have ever eaten . the wild boar itself , was absolutely to die for . my husband and i swore we would be back , simply for us both to eat this dish again . it is a must have . enjoy !',\n",

              " 'i ended the work week on a nice note when i met donald s and a new friend at tacos de juarez for lunch on friday . we enjoyed good conversation amidst the early goodwill high back dining chairs , the formica tables mixed with the old ethan allen desks serving as tables thanks for that insight mark and crowd of diners from a broad swath of life . the chips were good , standard stuff . the red and green salsa was also tasty , although the red is mild bordering on hot and the green is just hot . i recommend waiting until your drink arrives before starting in on the green salsa . i wanted enchiladas . they come with cheese and i wanted one with cheese and one with chicken added . there was a bit of language difficulty and i ended up with chicken enchiladas . but let me start with the basics because that is where my judgment of a mexican restaurant begins : rice and beans . if they miss on the basic rice and beans then they will have a hard time getting me back . the rice and beans were good . not greasy , not dry . great . on to the enchiladas . the chicken enchiladas were smothered in a generous amount of enchilada sauce and cheese and filled with a hearty portion of stewed chicken . good stuff . i will absolutely add tacos de juarez to my list of good cheap restaurants . and having been in the el paso juarez area recently i can say that even though the neighborhood immediately surrounding tacos de juarez looks a little sketchy it is not . for example there were no poor souls executed and left hanging from a chain link fence here as there was a couple weeks ago along the border .',\n",

              " 'it s a big airport . . . but it s also an easy to navigate airport . you won t starve with the food selections , coffee is everywhere and it s fairly clean . i fly in and out of phx a few times a year and i have never really had any issues . just be careful existing because one wrong turn and you can wind up on the opposite end of phoenix and it s a hassle to get back on track .',\n",
              " 'i have been to phx airport probably about times throughout the years as it serves as the hub for southwest airlines on the west coast . this airport is easy to get in and out of and rarely is delayed , the amenities are plentiful and the dining is getting better every year . do yourself a favor and grab a pizza and beer from humble pie if you have time . it s a great spot to catch some sports or just people watch .',\n",
